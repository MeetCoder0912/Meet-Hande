# Sentiment-Driven-Trading-Analysis

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

This project utilizes a comprehensive stack of tools and technologies for data analysis, machine learning, and interactive visualization:

### 🐍 Programming Language
- **Python**: Core language used for scripting, data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.

### 📊 Data Manipulation & Analysis
- **Pandas**: For data loading, cleaning, transformation, and analysis, including trading metrics and market sentiment (Fear & Greed Index).
- **NumPy**: Used for efficient numerical and mathematical operations.

### 📈 Data Visualization
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive plots.
- **Seaborn**: Built on top of Matplotlib, used for statistical visualization and enhanced data storytelling.

### 🤖 Machine Learning
- **Scikit-learn**: Primary library used for building and evaluating machine learning models.
  - `RandomForestClassifier`: Chosen classification algorithm.
  - `train_test_split`: To split data into training and testing sets.
  - `accuracy_score` & `classification_report`: Metrics to evaluate model performance.

### 💻 Development Environment & Interactivity
- **Google Colab / IPython**: Cloud-based, interactive coding environment used for development and experimentation.
- **ipywidgets**: Enabled interactive UI components within the notebook to test and explore model behavior.

### 🧠 AI-Assisted Development
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Used for:
  - Generating code snippets
  - Debugging support
  - Writing explanatory documentation
- **Prompt Engineering**: Applied to guide LLMs effectively for context-aware, precise output generation, enhancing productivity and accuracy.
